## _Integrating Theory, Research, and Practice in Vocational Psychology: Current Status and Future Directions_ 

This publication is based on the 2016 Society for Vocational Psychology (SVP) Biennial Conference, that was held at the Florida State University on May 16-17, 2016. The conference theme was "Integrating Theory, Research, and Practice in Vocational Psychology." The conference content and the resulting edited book are based on the assumption that the science and practice of vocational psychology are more successful with the integration of theory, research, and practice.

HEAL stands for *Humanism Evolving Through Arts and Literature*. Bringing together writing and art from a variety of sources, HEAL is a platform where medical students share their growth and development, where faculty and staff impart their knowledge gained from experience, and where members of the community express how health and healing have impacted their lives. HEAL strives to bridge the growing gap between patients and their providers while hoping to produce a meaningful creative outlet to those who participate in the publication of its quarterly digital issues and annual print journal. 

HEAL contains a mixture of pieces from many sources that, when combined, can be used as a tool for promoting humanism in medicine. HEAL creates partnerships between medical students, health care professionals, and patients through artistic collaboration. Readers experience a variety of perspectives, and can then reevaluate their paradigms and seek a new, positive healthcare experience.

HEAL is a publication of the FSU College of Medicine.

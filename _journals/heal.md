Humanism Evolving Through Arts and Literature (*HEAL*) brings together writing and art from a variety of sources, providing a platform for medical students to share their growth and development, for faculty and staff to impart their knowledge gained from experience, and for members of the community to express how health and healing have impacted their lives.

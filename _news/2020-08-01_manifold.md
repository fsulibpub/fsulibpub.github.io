Florida State Open Publishing now hosts Manifold, a publishing platform for dynamic digital texts with rich media support and annotation tools. Manifold is an intuitive, collaborative, open-source platform for scholarly publishing. With Manifold, students and faculty can publish digital scholarship with multimedia and use annotation tools for private notes or public dialogue. Manifold transforms scholarly publications into living digital works. This FSOP installation serves as a free publishing platform for FSU faculty and students to house their scholarship, custom classroom versions of texts, and open textbooks and course materials that are openly licensed or in the public domain.

Visit Manifold at [manifold.lib.fsu.edu](https://manifold.lib.fsu.edu/) or [contact us](https://www.lib.fsu.edu/DRS/form/contact-us "DRS Proposal Form") to propose a new project.

At Florida State Open Publishing, we are excited to launch a new website to highlight our publishing projects and partnerships. The website features a catalog of journals, scholarly books, open textbooks, and digital scholarship projects that we have published in partnership with faculty and students at Florida State University (FSU). We encourage you to explore the new website to learn more about our <a href="http://publishing.lib.fsu.edu/about/">mission and publishing services</a>. We consult on a variety of scholarly communication topics and digital publishing tools. We provide open access publishing expertise, services, and platforms to enhance the scholarly output of FSU students, faculty, and staff. <a href="http://publishing.lib.fsu.edu/contact/">Our staff</a> will update this site as our suite of services and portfolio of completed projects continues to grow. 

[Contact us](https://www.lib.fsu.edu/DRS/form/contact-us) to propose a project or schedule a consultation.

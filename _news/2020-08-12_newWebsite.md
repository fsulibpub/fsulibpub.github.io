The FSU Libraries introduce a new website to highlight library publishing projects. The website features a catalog of journals, books and open textbooks, and digital scholarship projects supported by the Libraries. We consult on a variety of scholarly communication topics and digital publishing tools. We provide open access publishing expertise, services, and platforms to enhance the scholarly output of FSU students, faculty, and staff. Our staff will update this site as we continue to partner with students and faculty to publish scholarly works. 

[Contact us](https://www.lib.fsu.edu/DRS/form/contact-us) to propose a project or schedule a consultation.

Florida State Open Publishing is excited to announce the addition of a new translation project: Natsume Sōseki Poems. These poems were translated by Matthew Mewhinney, Assistant Professor in the Department of Modern Languages. This multimedia digital database compiles the traditional poetry and visual media of modern Japanese novelist, critic, philosopher and poet Natsume Sōseki 夏目漱石 (1867-1916). 

The project currently contains 208 *kanshi*, and *haiku* will be added in the near future. To read the poems and their translations and learn more about the project, see [https://fsudrs.github.io/soseki/](https://fsudrs.github.io/soseki/)

ItaliaNoles Magazine is now hosted on Open Journal Systems by Florida State Open Publishing. ItaliaNoles is a semi-annual digital magazine produced by students in the study abroad program at the Florida State University Florence campus. Students research and write articles, collect photographs, and design the layout for the magazine. ItaliaNoles articles and interviews highlight Florence culture, cuisine, student life, and other special topics.

Seven back issues of the magazine were transferred from their previous platform into OJS in December 2020. Read the recent issue at [https://journals.flvc.org/italianoles/index](https://journals.flvc.org/italianoles/index)

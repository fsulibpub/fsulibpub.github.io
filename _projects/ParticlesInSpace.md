[*Particles in Space*](https://drodz11.github.io/particlesinspace/) is an on-going exhibition and research project that converges digital humanities practices with the histories and study of experimental film & video. Building on the field of [Volumetric Cinema](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled-f2acf72c-a469-49d8-be35-67f9ac1e3a60/section/a214af4f-2d31-4967-8686-738987c02ddf) first developed by Kevin L. Ferguson, the moving-image works examined in this series are digitally disassembled and rendered in three-dimensions using [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and the open-source image analysis software, [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/Welcome). Transformed from their original photochemical or electronic formats into 3D objects, we are able to study and experience these works in entirely new ways that are unconstrained by conventional theories and practices of cinematic spectatorship.

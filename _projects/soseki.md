This multimedia digital edition compiles the traditional poetry and visual media of modern Japanese novelist, critic, philosopher and poet Natsume Sōseki 夏目漱石 (1867-1916). This edition offers the first complete translation of Sōseki’s kanshi, and the first multimedia digital database to include Sōseki’s kanshi, a selection of haiku and related images.

The project is a collaboration between Matthew Mewhinney, Assistant Professor in the Department of Modern Languages, and the Office of Digital Research and Scholarship. The digital edition uses [JekyllHIDE](https://github.com/fsudrs/jekyllhide), a static-site publisher and theme for digital editions. The first round of poems was published in the summer of 2020, and more poetry will be added on a continuous basis.

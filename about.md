## Policies 

### Diversity Policy
We are committed to an environment that welcomes, values, respects and supports the differences and contributions of all members and partners at Florida State and in the global community. We actively cultivate partnerships, author relationships, and a portfolio of scholarly works that reflect the diversity of scholarly communities at FSU and around the world. We are dedicated to facilitating an inclusive scholarly dialogue grounded in respect and appreciation for all individuals and seeks to increase the voices of less represented scholars in the scholarly community. As an open access publisher, we seek to ensure that all communities have the broadest access to knowledge and research scholarship produced by FSU authors through accessible digital platforms and discoverable works.

### Preservation Policy

We commit to preserving the intellectual content of our projects in perpetuity, according to current digital preservation best practices. We are committed to preserving a usable version of all projects and publications. For projects with highly customized interactive presentations, the preservation strategy may include a combination of approaches, including the preservation of a simplified version of the publication alongside the underlying, raw machine-readable code for the complete project. 

### Open Access Policy
We publish exclusively open access content, and do not restrict access to publications behind a paywall. Our publications are released under a Creative Commons (CC) license chosen by the author(s) or editor(s) of the given work. Specific details on copyright ownership in works and licensing of works can be found on individual publication sites.

### Accessibility Policy
We strive to meet accessibility best practices for web publication. We provide accessibility best practices information to authors and editors, and complete a technical check for long-form publications that includes a review of accessibility issues before a title is published in its final form and listed in our publications catalog. We welcome notification from users if one or more of our titles does not meet an accessibility standard. In cases where accessibility challenges stem from the underlying platforms we use, we will work with the open source development community to report problems and identify solutions.
Peer review 
All works published by the Florida State University Libraries are peer reviewed. Journals may select their desired form of peer review (double blind, single blind, or open peer review), and monographs, open educational resources, and digital scholarship projects may undergo post-publication review. Student journals and projects are sponsored and reviewed by a faculty advisor.

### Core principles 
- We believe that the Libraries are critical resources for publishing expertise on campus.
- We believe that the unfettered flow of ideas, scholarship, and knowledge is necessary to support learning, research, and creativity.
- We support FSU faculty, students, and staff by making their work available to audiences around the world via open access publishing.
- We believe that the scholarly ecosystem works best when creators retain their copyrights. 
- We believe in experimentation and innovation in academic publishing.
- We work to decrease the cost of higher education and improve learning outcomes for students by publishing open textbooks and other open educational resources.
- We believe in the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and promote these values through our publications.
- We believe in promoting the work of marginalized scholars and underrepresented voices.
- We believe in crediting labor.
- We commit to making our publications accessible to all who need to use them.
- We seek to create partnerships on campus and with the broader Tallahassee community.
